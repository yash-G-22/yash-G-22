## 🌟 Featured Project Spotlight

### 🔍 [Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)](https://github.com/username/anpr-project)

**A cutting-edge computer vision application that revolutionizes vehicle identification**

```python
# Real-time license plate detection and recognition
model = load_pytorch_model()
result = model.detect_and_recognize(uploaded_image)
print(f"Detected Plate: {result.plate_number}")
```

**Tech Stack:** `Python` `Flask` `PyTorch` `OpenCV` `HTML/CSS`

This project represents the perfect fusion of deep learning and practical application, developed during my summer internship at HRCL. It demonstrates real-world problem-solving using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques.
